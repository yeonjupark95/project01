            <p class="project1-content">Not going to lie, I was looking at Jennie from Black Pink when I was drawing this girl. Although this does not look anything at all like Jennie, I still like how it turned out and the yellow accent on her.
            <p class="project1-content">Please remember that this is just an example of my art work. This page will be soon replaced with the projects I'll be completing during my coding bootcamp.</p>
